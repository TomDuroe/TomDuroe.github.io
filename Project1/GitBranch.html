<h1>What is a Git Branch?</h1>
<p> 
    A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository
    but does not affect the primary or main branch. This allows you to work freely without 
    disrupting the live version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can 
    merge your branch back into the main branch to publish your changes.
